# Weather-Dashboard-with-LocationTracking

Get weather data at your current location and other cities 

## Usage
Being a travel enthusiast, I would like to know the weather and forecast for a city and have quick access to a few cities I plan to include in my travel. This weather only shows the parameters that matter the most, and stores the names of the 5 most recently searched cities so that they can be quickly accessed.
If the user allows location tracking, this app gives the weather outlook of the user's current location. 
On the initial use, the user is shown quick access options for some of the major US cities, which then changes to the users recent searches.

## Limitations
For the 5-day forecast, ideally, a daily 24-hour forecast data is required for accuracy. Openweatherapi's free subscription only provides access to 5-day 3-hour forecast to get a forecast. The forecast starts 3-6 hours from the time the app is accessed. For this reason, data was sampled randomly for each day, which is not most accurate.

## Credits
Openweatherapi was used to get the weather data. Moment.js was used for conversion of time format. w3schools.com and stackoverflow.com were used try to resolve some obstables encountered.

## Future enhancements
An access to daily 24-hour forecast data would make this app more reliable.
